            <h2>About VINs</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Vehicle identification numbers (VINs) were first used by auto manufacturers in 1954. Between 1954 and 1981, there wasn't a standard format and VINs varied considerably between manufacturers. Under standards set by the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA), every car and light truck model year 1981 or later has a unique 17-digit VIN in a fixed format.</p>
